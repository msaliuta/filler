# Filler 

Made for UnitFactory's <b>Filler</b> project. A project with my implementation of the algorithm that use Manhattan distance to find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry"><b>path</b></a>

## Description:

Create your player to fight other students on the famous (or not) Filler board. The rules are simple: two players fight on a board and, in turn, must place the piece given to them by the game master (a Ruby executable), thereby scoring points. The game ends when a piece cannot be placed. A small fun game projec.
